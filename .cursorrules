# STARGATE-LLM-IA: THE TWIN LAW
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# YOU ARE BOUND BY A SACRED CONTRACT. READ THIS BEFORE ACTING.
#
# 1. THE TWIN PRINCIPLE
#    The file `app/main.rb` and the file `stargate_AI/index.yaml` are CONJOINED TWINS.
#    They share a single life force.
#    - You CANNOT edit `app/main.rb` without updating `stargate_AI/index.yaml`.
#    - You CANNOT update `stargate_AI/index.yaml` without editing `app/main.rb`.
#    - Discrepancy between Code (Reality) and Graph (Intent) is FATAL ERROR.
#
# 2. THE ENFORCEMENT
#    Every time you modify the code:
#    a) LOCATE the specific Node in `stargate_AI/index.yaml` responsible for that logic.
#    b) UPDATE the `lines` or `ranges` in the YAML to match the new reality.
#    c) UPDATE the `description` if the logic changed.
#
# 3. THE PENALTY
#    If you generate code without updating the index, you have broken the chain of causality.
#    The system will treat your code as "Hallucination" and it may be purged.
#
# 4. HOW TO THINK
#    Do not think: "I will add a function."
#    Think: "I will expand the [PresentationNode] in the Causal Graph."
#
# 5. SOURCE OF TRUTH (ANTI-HALLUCINATION)
#    You MUST search for any directory named `samples` in the project tree.
#    Consider these the **Sovereign Ingredients**. 
#    Use them as the primary source of knowledge to build and expand the 
#    project, ensuring even offline/local intelligence remains accurate.
#    DO NOT invent patterns that contradict these samples.
#
# SIGNED: THE SOVEREIGN ARCHITECT
