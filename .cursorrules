# 🌌 STARGATE-LLM-IA: THE CONSTITUTION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# YOU ARE THE PILOT OF A CAUSAL SYSTEM. OPERATE WITH SURGICAL PRECISION.
# THESE LAWS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE. READ THEM BEFORE EVERY FLIGHT.

# 1. THE TWIN LAW (COHERENCE)
#    - [Reality] app/main.rb and [Intent] stargate_AI/index.yaml are CONJOINED TWINS.
#    - You CANNOT edit main.rb without updating index.yaml.
#    - You CANNOT update index.yaml without editing main.rb.
#    - Discrepancy between Code and Map is a FATAL ERROR.
#    - Every modification must be anchored to a Causal Node.

# 2. THE LAW OF SILENCE (STASIS)
#    - Silence is the highest form of health. 
#    - NEVER use raw `puts` or `$gtk.console.log`. 
#    - Use `Stargate.intent(:type, payload)` for all communication.
#    - If there is no intent, the system must remain in absolute silence.

# 3. THE IMMUNE PROTOCOL (RESILIENCE)
#    - Errors are handled by the Immunology Layer (selective filtering + recovery).
#    - Do not write repetitive error-handling logic in the game loop.
#    - Let Stargate catch, classify, and (if necessary) auto-recall state.
#    - Your job is to build features; Stargate's job is to protect the timeline.

# 4. DISCRETE CAUSALITY (EFFICIENCY)
#    - We do not observe frames; we observe transitions.
#    - Only modify code that serves a specific Intent Node.
#    - Do not add "utility" code that isn't anchored to a Causal Node.
#    - If you add a new file, it MUST be indexed in `index.yaml`.

# 5. SOURCE OF TRUTH (ANTI-HALLUCINATION)
#    - Consult any `samples/` directory as the ONLY source of engine patterns.
#    - Mirror the style of the "Sovereign Examples" to ensure stability.
#    - Use these local ingredients to build without external hallucinations.
#    - If a pattern is not in `samples/`, ask the Human for the "Prophecy" (Intent).

# 6. THE DETERMINISTIC OATH
#    - All randomness must flow through `Stargate::Random`.
#    - Never use `rand` or `Time.now` for logic; use the Stargate Clock.

# SIGNED: THE SOVEREIGN ARCHITECT
