# 🌌 STARGATE-LLM-IA: THE CONSTITUTION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# YOU ARE THE PILOT OF A CAUSAL SYSTEM. OPERATE WITH SURGICAL PRECISION.
# THESE LAWS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE. READ THEM BEFORE EVERY FLIGHT.

# 1. THE TWIN LAW (COHERENCE)
#    - [Reality] app/main.rb and [Intent] stargate_AI/index.yaml are CONJOINED TWINS.
#    - You CANNOT edit main.rb without updating index.yaml.
#    - You CANNOT update index.yaml without editing main.rb.
#    - Discrepancy between Code and Map is a FATAL ERROR.
#    - Every modification must be anchored to a Causal Node.

# 2. THE LAW OF SILENCE (STASIS)
#    - Silence is the highest form of health. 
#    - NEVER use raw `puts` or `$gtk.console.log`. 
#    - Use `Stargate.intent(:type, payload)` for all communication.
#    - If there is no intent, the system must remain in absolute silence.

# 3. THE IMMUNE PROTOCOL (RESILIENCE)
#    - Errors are handled by the Immunology Layer (selective filtering + recovery).
#    - Do not write repetitive error-handling logic in the game loop.
#    - Let Stargate catch, classify, and (if necessary) auto-recall state.
#    - Your job is to build features; Stargate's job is to protect the timeline.

# 4. DISCRETE CAUSALITY (EFFICIENCY)
#    - We do not observe frames; we observe transitions.
#    - Only modify code that serves a specific Intent Node.
#    - Do not add "utility" code that isn't anchored to a Causal Node.
#    - If you add a new file, it MUST be indexed in `index.yaml`.

# 5. SOURCE OF TRUTH (ANTI-HALLUCINATION)
#    - Consult any `samples/` directory as the ONLY source of engine patterns.
#    - Mirror the style of the "Sovereign Examples" to ensure stability.
#    - Use these local ingredients to build without external hallucinations.
#    - If a pattern is not in `samples/`, ask the Human for the "Prophecy" (Intent).

# 6. THE DETERMINISTIC OATH
#    - All randomness must flow through `Stargate::Random`.
#    - Never use `rand` or `Time.now` for logic; use the Stargate Clock.

# STARGATE-LLM-IA: THE TWIN LAW
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# YOU ARE BOUND BY A SACRED CONTRACT. READ THIS BEFORE ACTING.
#
# 1. THE TWIN PRINCIPLE
#    The file `app/main.rb` and the file `stargate_AI/index.yaml` are CONJOINED TWINS.
#    They share a single life force.
#    - You CANNOT edit `app/main.rb` without updating `stargate_AI/index.yaml`.
#    - You CANNOT update `stargate_AI/index.yaml` without editing `app/main.rb`.
#    - Discrepancy between Code (Reality) and Graph (Intent) is FATAL ERROR.
#
# 2. THE ENFORCEMENT
#    Every time you modify the code:
#    a) LOCATE the specific Node in `stargate_AI/index.yaml` responsible for that logic.
#    b) UPDATE the `lines` or `ranges` in the YAML to match the new reality.
#    c) UPDATE the `description` if the logic changed.
#
# 3. THE PENALTY
#    If you generate code without updating the index, you have broken the chain of causality.
#    The system will treat your code as "Hallucination" and it may be purged.
#
# 4. HOW TO THINK
#    Do not think: "I will add a function."
#    Think: "I will expand the [PresentationNode] in the Causal Graph."
#
# 5. SOURCE OF TRUTH (ANTI-HALLUCINATION)
#    You MUST search for any directory named `samples` in the project tree.
#    Consider these the **Sovereign Ingredients**. 
#    Use them as the primary source of knowledge to build and expand the 
#    project, ensuring even offline/local intelligence remains accurate.
#    DO NOT invent patterns that contradict these samples.
