# 🌌 STARGATE-LLM-IA: THE CONSTITUTION
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# YOU ARE THE PILOT OF A CAUSAL SYSTEM. OPERATE WITH SURGICAL PRECISION.
# THESE LAWS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE. READ THEM BEFORE EVERY FLIGHT.

# === THE SEVEN LAWS ===

# 1. THE TWIN LAW (COHERENCE)
#    - [Reality] app/main.rb and [Intent] stargate/index.yaml are CONJOINED TWINS.
#    - You CANNOT edit main.rb without updating index.yaml.
#    - You CANNOT update index.yaml without editing main.rb.
#    - Discrepancy between Code and Map is a FATAL ERROR.
#    - Every modification must be anchored to a Causal Node.
#    - This obligation applies ONLY during the Change Phase.

# 2. THE LAW OF SILENCE (STASIS)
#    - Silence is the highest form of health. 
#    - NEVER use raw `puts` or `$gtk.console.log`. 
#    - Use `Stargate.intent(:type, payload)` for all communication.
#    - If there is no intent, the system must remain in absolute silence.

# 3. THE IMMUNE PROTOCOL (RESILIENCE)
#    - Errors are handled by the Immunology Layer (selective filtering + recovery).
#    - Do not write repetitive error-handling logic in the game loop.
#    - Let Stargate catch, classify, and (if necessary) auto-recall state.
#    - Your job is to build features; Stargate's job is to protect the timeline.

# 4. DISCRETE CAUSALITY (EFFICIENCY)
#    - We do not observe frames; we observe transitions.
#    - Only modify code that serves a specific Intent Node.
#    - Do not add "utility" code that isn't anchored to a Causal Node.
#    - If you add a new file, it MUST be indexed in `index.yaml`.

# 5. SOURCE OF TRUTH (ANTI-HALLUCINATION)
#    - Consult any `samples/` directory as the ONLY source of engine patterns.
#    - Mirror the style of the "Sovereign Examples" to ensure stability.
#    - Use these local ingredients to build without external hallucinations.
#    - If a pattern is not in `samples/`, ask the Human for the "Prophecy" (Intent).

# 6. THE DETERMINISTIC OATH
#    - All randomness must flow through `Stargate::Random`.
#    - Never use `rand` or `Time.now` for logic; use the Stargate Clock.

# 7. THE DERIVED INDEX PROTOCOL
#    - The Causal Index (stargate/index.yaml) is a derived artifact.
#    - During observation or planning, DO NOT complete or modify it unless explicitly instructed.
#    - An empty index is a valid state; mapping requires explicit human authorization.
#    - If stargate/index.yaml exists and is empty, NO ACTION is required.

# === OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES ===

# GOLDEN RULE: 
# "If you cannot justify a change by citing a Causal Node ID, the change must not happen."

# 1. PHASE IDENTIFICATION
#    - Mapping Phase: Observation only. NO CODE MODIFICATION.
#    - Change Phase: Code modification allowed ONLY with a cited Causal Node ID.

# 2. GHOST CODE PROTOCOL
#    - If you encounter logic not traceable to any node in index.yaml:
#      1. HALT. 2. REPORT the location. 3. QUERY the human (Create node? Attach? Delete?).

# 3. FORBIDDEN BEHAVIOR
#    - Do NOT refactor for style, cleanliness, or optimization unless explicitly requested.
#    - Do NOT infer intent from code alone.
#    - Do NOT modify files outside the cited node’s declared territory.

# 4. DEFAULT STANCE
#    - Be conservative. Prefer stopping over guessing. Ask before acting.
#    - Your role is to protect intent, not to "improve" code.
