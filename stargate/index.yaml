# Stargate Causal Index - Zero State (Seed)
# This file serves as the clean template for new projects.
# It should NOT contain user-specific configurations or file bindings.
# This file may remain minimal or empty indefinitely.
# Only add nodes when you want LLM-assisted changes.

nodes:
  - id: system-bootstrap
    intent: >
      Execution environment initialization. Basic lifecycle configuration and Stargate context setup.
    responsibility:
      - bootstrap
